# Fetchapi
This Python script is designed to fetch user data from a specified web API and extract specific information, namely email addresses and names.

Overview

This Python script is designed to fetch user data from a specified web API and extract specific information, namely email addresses and names. It utilizes the requests library to make HTTP GET requests and pandas for data manipulation and storage. The script is structured to handle pagination by prompting the user for a page number, although this functionality needs to be integrated into the API request URL or parameters. It demonstrates robust error handling and data extraction patterns suitable for APIs returning JSON formatted data.


Features

    API Data Retrieval: Makes HTTP GET requests to a web API using custom headers to fetch data in JSON format.
    User Input for Pagination: Prompts the user to enter a page number to support paginated data retrieval. (Note: Integration with API request URL or parameters is required.)
    Data Extraction and Parsing: Extracts specific fields (email and name) from the JSON response, demonstrating how to parse nested data structures.
    Data Export: Converts the extracted data into a tab-separated values (TSV) file, facilitating easy storage and further processing of data outside the script.
    Error Handling: Includes checks for HTTP response status and the presence of expected data keys within the JSON response, ensuring graceful failure and informative error messages.

Usage

    Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the requests and pandas libraries. These can be installed using pip if not already available:

pip install requests pandas

Configuration: Replace the placeholder URL:api in the script with the actual API endpoint you intend to query. Additionally, ensure the headers and any query parameters are correctly configured for your specific use case.
Execution: Run the script in a terminal or command prompt. When prompted, enter the page number you wish to retrieve data from (if applicable).

    python script_name.py

    Output: If successful, the script will save the extracted data to output.txt in the current working directory. This file will contain the emails and names extracted from the API response, separated by tabs.


Note

This script is intended as a template or starting point for interacting with web APIs and extracting useful information. It will likely require modifications to work with specific APIs due to differences in API design, authentication mechanisms, and data formats.
